            <h3><br>A Sad Little Frog</h3>
            <p>A little frog on a lilypad in a pond.</p>
            <p>He laid awake singing a sad song.</p>
            <p>He <em>missed</em> his toad friend who moved away,</p>
            <p>and hoped he could see him <strong>one more day</strong>.</p>
            <p>Little frog singing a sad song</p>
            <p><br>all day long.</p>
            <p><br>But the fog <strong>cleared</strong> and the frog jumped with joy</p>
            <p>Toad was here, his favorite boy!</p>
            <p>They hugged and he smiled with glee.</p>
            <p>Toad made him so <em>happy</em>.</p>
